                All of my favorite projects involve visuals that can allow anyone to get a high level understanding of
                what is going on. In my AI class, one of my projects involved working with mazes and using search 
                algorithms on them. I worked in a group with two other people. Here you can see how different algorithms
                found different paths through randomly generated mazes.

                Above you can see the classic breadth first search and depth first search algorithms, ran on the same graph. This is really nothing special, but are useful for comparing with other algorithms.

                These results are prime examples of the usefulness of a good visual. Both of the algorithms are informed
                searches, meaning that they pick their next move based off of the shortest distance, but they do so in
                different ways.

                The green line is Euclidean distance, it is the most direct path that assumes you can move in any direction.
                While this is not accurate for the maze, when the algorithm used euclidean distance the path it followed
                was as close to a diagonal line as possible.
                Meanwhile, Manhattan distance assumes you can only move in the four cardinal directions. This caused the
                algorithm to follow a less direct path, something akin to the yellow line in the image above.
                <br><br>Another part of the project involved creating the hardest possible graph for a given search algorithm, by some measure of "difficulty". I used a search algorithm that experimented with inverting cells,
                called beam search to make the hardest possible graph for the depth first search algorithm. I ended up getting some great visuals out of it, with the graph getting harder and harder for DFS.

                I really like these images. We can see the maze getting harder and harder to solve, as the computer
                places blocks to better and better exploit the fact that our implementation of depth first search
                prioritizes going right, then down, then left, and lastly up.
                The path curves to and fro, and makes use of the pre-existing walls that the graph started with.
